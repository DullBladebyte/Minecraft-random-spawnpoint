# Minecraft-random-spawnpoint


A datapack for 1.16, that sets your spawn location close to your death point.

Great for maps and for exploring; as the death punishment is not as severe. 

# Functions in every dimension (kind of)

Works great on both the end and the overworld…


But struggles in the nether

The reason is because it uses the “spreadplayers” command that tries to find an open surface to teleport the player to (in this case an armor stand). And the only open surface in the nether is the bedrock roof. So, to combat this I teleport the armor stand down 80 blocks. While that solves the issue, sometimes it will put you above lava oceans or in a hole surrounded by netherrack. 

The moral of the story is that you shouldn’t play with this pack in the nether

But if you are feeling adventurous here are some nether tips:

Have keepinventory on (believe me you need it).

When in a netherrack hole, mine upwards.

You have some seconds of invulnerability when you respawn, abuse them.

# Suggestions:

Parkour on a city map.

Make a dungeon map.

Try fighting the dragon.

Explore the end.

Have keepinventory on.

Enjoy!
